### Boy Scout Rule

Leave your code better than you found it.<br />
If your code needs comments, consider refactoring it so it doesn't.<br />
Beauty is born of and found in simplicity.<br />
Fixing bugs is not making progress. You aren't paid to debug. Debugging is waste.<br />
One of software's biggest obstacles is smart people who purposefully propagate the guru myth.<br />
A comment is of zero (or negative) value if it is wrong.<br />
Write code as if you had to support it for the rest of your life.<br />
